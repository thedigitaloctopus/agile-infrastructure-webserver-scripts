# Description: If your application requires any post processing to be performed, then,
# this is the place to put it. Post processing is considered to be any processing which
# is required after the application is considered installed. This is the post processing
# for a joomla install. If you examine the code, you will find that this script is called
# from the build client over ssh once it considers that the application has been fully installed.
#   ***********IMPORTANT*****************
#   These post processing scipts are not run using sudo as is normally the case, this is because
#   of issues with stdin and so on. So if a command requires privilege then sudo must be used
#   on a command by command basis. This is true for all PerformPostProcessing Scripts
