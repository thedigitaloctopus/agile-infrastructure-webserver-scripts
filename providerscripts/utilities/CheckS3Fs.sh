# Description: I have seen s3fs become unresponsive during testing. This is a cludge
# which monitors if the S3FS filesystem has become unresponsive (which hopefully never happens)
# but, if it does we do an emergency reboot to clear it out and keep the server online
# which is a better option than having our S3FS hosed.
