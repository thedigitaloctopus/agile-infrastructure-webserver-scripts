# Description : When I was using S3FS, I wanted to use it as a lock mechanism at times, in other words,
# write a file to S3FS on one machine and test for its existence on another. What I found though was that
# when I removed the lock file on one machine it would still be listed from other machines in other words
# the filesystem change wasn't be reflected across machines. This is how I decided to work around it
# by testing in the S3 bucket directly for the files existence.
